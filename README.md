I've decided to make my own backtester. I'll simply be using venv as an environment.

create env 

`python3 -m venv algotrading`

activate env

`source algotrading/bin/activate`

install requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Following the template for event driven backtester development outlined in this series
