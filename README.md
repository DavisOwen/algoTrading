# algoTrading

I've decided to make my own backtester. I'll simply be using venv as an environment.

create env 

`python3 -m venv algotrading`

activate env

`source algotrading/bin/activate`

install requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Following the template for event driven backtester development outlined in this series

https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I

Sphinx documentation:

make .rst for any new modules and run make html to regenerate docs in _build/html/index.html.

Will autogenerate documentation based on properly formatted comments.
